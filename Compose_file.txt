The Compose File:

The default path for a Compose file is "docker-compose.yaml" that is placed in the working directory.
You can use fragments and extensions to keep your Compose file efficient and easy to maintain.

Multiple Compose files can be merged together.
The combination of YAML files is implemented by appending or overriding YAML elements based on the Compose file order you set.
Simple attributes and maps get overridden by the highest order Compose file, lists get merged by appending.

If you want to reuse other Compose files, or factor out parts of your application model into separate Compose files, you can also use include.
This is useful if your Compose application is dependent on another application which is managed by a different team, or needs to be shared with others.
