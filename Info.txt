Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.
The isolation and security lets you run many containers simultaneously on a given host.

Docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers:

- Develop your application and its supporting components using containers.
- The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application.
- When you're ready, deploy your application into your production environment, as a container or an orchestrated service.
  This works the same whether your production environment is a local data center, a cloud provider, or a hybrid of the two.

Docker used for:

- Fast, consistent delivery of your applications;
- - work in standardized environments using local containers, great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows.
- Responsive deployment and scaling;
- - highly portable workloads. Docker containers can run on a developer's local laptop, on physical or virtual machines in a data center,
	on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments.
- Running more workloads on the same hardware;
- -
